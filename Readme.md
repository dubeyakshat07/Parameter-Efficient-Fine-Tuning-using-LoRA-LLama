# Fine-Tuning LLaMA 2 on Custom Data

This notebook provides a comprehensive workflow to fine-tune Meta's **LLaMA 2** language model using Hugging Face's `transformers` and `datasets` libraries. The pipeline includes data preparation, prompt formatting (especially for instruction-tuned models), tokenizer setup, LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and final model training.

## üîç Overview

LLaMA 2 models are powerful foundational LLMs. Fine-tuning them on domain-specific or task-specific data enables significantly improved performance. This notebook implements:

- Installation of required libraries.
- Use of chat-style prompt templates.
- Instruction tuning using a defined input/output prompt schema.
- Use of Hugging Face datasets for loading and formatting data.
- Efficient fine-tuning using the LoRA technique.
- Model saving and inference.

## üß† Prompt Template (Chat-style Format)

For LLaMA 2 instruction tuning, we use the following prompt schema:

```

<|system|>
System prompt (optional)

<|user|>
User question or instruction

<|assistant|>
Model answer

```

This helps align the model‚Äôs behavior in a chat-like instruction-following manner.

## üì¶ Requirements

The notebook installs the following key packages:

- `transformers`
- `peft`
- `accelerate`
- `bitsandbytes`
- `datasets`
- `scipy`
- `sentencepiece`

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies
The notebook automatically installs all the required Python libraries via pip.

### 2. Load and Format Dataset
Load datasets using `load_dataset()` and format them using the chat prompt schema. Ensure your dataset has columns like `instruction`, `input`, and `output`.

### 3. Tokenize Dataset
The tokenizer is initialized with the pretrained LLaMA 2 tokenizer. Prompts are tokenized with appropriate padding and truncation.

### 4. Fine-Tune with LoRA
LoRA is used for parameter-efficient tuning. Key parameters configured:

- `r`: Low-rank dimension.
- `alpha`: Scaling factor.
- `target_modules`: Specific modules (e.g., `q_proj`, `v_proj`) to be adapted.
- Training uses Hugging Face's `Trainer` API.

### 5. Save Model
After training, the adapter model and tokenizer are saved for inference.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Summary

- **Base Model**: `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`
- **Trainer**: Hugging Face `transformers.Trainer`
- **Training Technique**: LoRA from `peft`
- **Dataset Format**: Instruction-following with system/user/assistant roles

## üìà Applications

This fine-tuning approach is ideal for:

- Chatbots tailored to specific domains (e.g., healthcare, finance).
- Document summarization and Q&A systems.
- Conversational agents with domain expertise.
- Academic or organizational knowledge assistants.

## ‚úÖ Results

You can run the notebook to obtain a fine-tuned LLaMA 2 model checkpoint that performs well on your custom task. The training process includes evaluation metrics and logs for analysis.
